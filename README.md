# Tic Tac Toe

This project is a simple implementation of the classic game Tic Tac Toe. It includes a restart feature that allows players to start a new game after the current game is over.

## Features

- Play against another player or against the computer.
- Restart the game at any time.
- Display the current player's turn.
- Highlight the winning combination of cells.
- Implement the logic for checking a win or a draw.

## Usage

To play the game, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Open the `index.html` file in your web browser.
3. Start playing by clicking on the cells to make your moves.
4. If the game is over, click the "Restart" button to start a new game.

## Implementation

The game logic is implemented in the `script.js` file. It handles the player turns, checks for a win or a draw, and updates the game board accordingly. The restart feature is also implemented in this file.

Feel free to explore the code and make any modifications or improvements as needed.
